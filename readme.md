This library is a still unfinished port of my [Chicken Scheme](http://www.call-cc.org/) _egg_ [2d-primitives](https://github.com/pluizer/2d-primitives). 
All features provided by 2d-primitives will be available in Math-2d in due time. At the time it provides support for the following:

- Angles
- Vectors
- Circles
- Polygons
- Triangles
- Rectangles

Be sure to check out the [documentation](https://freeshell.de/~pluizer/javadoc/nl/pluizer/math2d/package-summary.html) for more information.
